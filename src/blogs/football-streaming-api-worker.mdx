# Building a Football Live Streaming API with Cloudflare Workers

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a fast and secure football match streaming API using Cloudflare Workers. We'll cover how to fetch match data from a third-party JSONP endpoint, handle CORS securely, parse the response, and return a structured JSON format including live stream links for frontend consumption.

## What You’ll Learn

- How to build serverless APIs using Cloudflare Workers
- How to parse JSONP-style responses safely
- How to implement strict CORS policies and origin whitelisting
- How to aggregate match data across multiple days
- How to extract and structure live streaming URLs

---

## Tech Stack

- Cloudflare Workers – serverless compute platform
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Regular Expression-based JSONP Parsing
- CORS Headers & Request Validation

## Worker Logic Overview

The following code outlines the core functionality of our API Worker.

```js
const ALLOWED_ORIGIN = "https://localhost:3000";

addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request).catch(handleError));
});
```

We restrict requests to a specific frontend origin to prevent abuse and enable CORS-controlled access.

```js
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const origin = request.headers.get("Origin");

  // CORS & Origin Check
  if (origin !== ALLOWED_ORIGIN) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: "Forbidden" }), {
      status: 403,
      headers: { "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "null" },
    });
  }

  // Preflight CORS Support
  if (request.method === "OPTIONS") {
    return new Response(null, {
      headers: {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": ALLOWED_ORIGIN,
        "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET, OPTIONS",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "*",
      },
    });
  }

  // Path validation
  if (!["/matches", "/matches/"].includes(url.pathname)) {
    return new Response("Not Found", {
      status: 404,
      headers: { "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": ALLOWED_ORIGIN },
    });
  }

  const referer = "https://socolivev.co/";
  const agent = request.headers.get("user-agent") || "Custom-Agent";

  const dates = [
    formatDate(Date.now() - 86400000),
    formatDate(Date.now()),
    formatDate(Date.now() + 86400000),
  ];

  let allMatches = [];
  for (const date of dates) {
    const matches = await fetchMatches(date, referer, agent);
    allMatches = allMatches.concat(matches);
  }

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(allMatches, null, 2), {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": ALLOWED_ORIGIN,
    },
  });
}
```

## How Match Fetching Works

We collect match data from a third-party endpoint <MyCode>json.vnres.co</MyCode>, which returns a JSONP-wrapped response like <MyCode>matches_20250512(...)</MyCode>. To parse it, we use:

```js
const txt = await res.text();
const match = txt.match(/matches_\d+\((.*)\)/);
const data = JSON.parse(match[1]);
```

After parsing, we evaluate each match's status and selectively fetch streaming links only for live matches:

```js
const { m3u8, hdM3u8 } = await fetchServerURL(roomNum);
```

This makes an internal call to:

```js
https://json.vnres.co/room/${roomNum}/detail.json
```

---

## Final JSON Response Format

Our API returns structured data in the following format:

```json
{
  "match_time": "1715527200",
  "match_status": "live",
  "home_team_name": "Team A",
  "away_team_name": "Team B",
  "league_name": "Premier League",
  "match_score": "2 - 1",
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "Soco SD",
      "stream_url": "https://cdn1.example/hls.m3u8",
      "referer": "https://socolivev.co/"
    },
    {
      "name": "Soco HD",
      "stream_url": "https://cdn1.example/hd.m3u8",
      "referer": "https://socolivev.co/"
    }
  ]
}
```

## CORS and Security Considerations

To enforce secure usage, we explicitly set:

```js
"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": ALLOWED_ORIGIN
```

## You can extend this to support multiple domains by maintaining a whitelist and validating the incoming origin header accordingly.

## Deploying to Cloudflare Workers

- Sign up at [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com)
- Install the Wrangler CLI and publish:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
wrangler init
wrangler publish
```

- Set environment variables or domain binding as needed.

## Conclusion

By using Cloudflare Workers, we’ve created a lightweight, scalable, and secure proxy API to aggregate football match data and stream URLs. This architecture is ideal for frontend apps that require real-time match information with minimal backend overhead.
